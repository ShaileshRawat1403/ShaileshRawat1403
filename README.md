### 🚀 Strategic Focus: The NLPg Frontier
I bridge the gap between business dynamics and Agentic AI. My work focuses on **Natural Language Programming (NLPg)**—shifting from brittle syntax to engineered intent.

| Competency | Focus Area | Philosophy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Design** | Agentic & Tool-Using Workflows | From single responses to systems that plan, act, and verify |
| **Context Engineering** | Intent, Constraints, Grounding | Correctness emerges from structure, not clever prompts |
| **Applied NLPg** | Language as Executable Logic | PRDs, specs, and policies are first-class inputs |
| **AI Enablement** | Adoption & Change | AI succeeds when humans stay in the control loop |
| **Documentation** | Explanation & Traceability | If it cannot be explained, it cannot be trusted |
