### 🚀 Strategic Focus: The NLPg Frontier

I work at the intersection of **AI systems, language, and human decision-making**.

My focus is **Natural Language Programming (NLPg)**: treating intent, constraints, and context as executable inputs—so systems behave predictably, responsibly, and usefully.

This is about moving from clever prompts to **engineered understanding**.

### 🧠 Core Capabilities (How I Work)

| Capability | What I Do | Why It Matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Systems Thinking** | Design agentic, tool-using workflows | AI must plan, act, verify, and fail safely |
| **Context Engineering** | Structure intent, constraints, and grounding | Correctness emerges from structure, not improvisation |
| **Applied NLPg** | Treat language as executable logic | PRDs, policies, and specs become system inputs |
| **AI Enablement & Comms** | Translate systems for humans | Adoption fails without trust and clarity |
| **Documentation & Traceability** | Explain behavior, limits, and decisions | If it can’t be explained, it can’t be trusted |
| **Applied Research** | Evaluate models, methods, and trade-offs | Decisions need evidence, not demos |

### 🔭 Currently Building

#### **Kvasir**
*A privacy-first, local LLM system for executive intelligence*

- **Intent:** Enable high-leverage decision support without data leakage
- **Mechanism:** Local SLMs, structured summarization, controlled drafting
- **Focus:** Practical intelligence, not chatbot theatrics

#### **Context Engineering Core**
*A framework for Intent-First Programming*

- **Intent:** Align LLM behavior with business KPIs and constraints
- **Mechanism:** Structured prompt logic, guardrails, evaluation hooks
- **Use case:** Enterprise-grade AI systems that can be reasoned about

---

### 🔬 Research & Exploration (Applied, Not Academic)

> **Current focus:** Fine-tuning and running Small Language Models (SLMs) locally using **Apple MLX**

What I actively research:
- Cost, latency, and privacy trade-offs of local inference
- Feasibility of SLMs for enterprise internal tooling
- Operational overhead of agentic systems and LLMOps
- Evaluation methods that go beyond “it feels better”

Research output is always tied to:
**adoption, risk, and operational reality**.

### 💬 I Care Deeply About

- Why your **PRD is actually your source code**
- The difference between **prompting (guesswork)** and **context engineering (science)**
- Building AI systems where **humans stay in the control loop**
- Documentation as a **trust mechanism**, not an afterthought
